Letâ€™s break down the key concepts using your example:

---

### 1. Static Methods

- `Object.assign()` is a **static method**.
- You call it with the class name (`Object`), not on an object instance.

---

### 2. Merging Objects and Overriding

```javascript
const target = { p: 1, a: 2 };
const source = { a: 3, b: 5 };

const retrunedObj = Object.assign(target, source);
console.log(retrunedObj); // {p: 1, a: 3, b: 5}
```

**What happens here?**

- `Object.assign(target, source)` copies all properties from `source` into `target`.
- If a key exists in both, the value from `source` **overrides** the value in `target`.
- Here, `a` in `target` was `2`, but after merging, it becomes `3` (from `source`).
- The result is `{p: 1, a: 3, b: 5}`.

---

### 3. Making a Shallow Copy

```javascript
const obj = { name: "tapaScript" };
const obj2 = Object.assign({}, obj);
console.log(obj2); // {name: "tapaScript"}
console.log(obj === obj2); // false
```

**What happens here?**

- `Object.assign({}, obj)` copies properties from `obj` into a new empty object.
- `obj2` is a **shallow copy** of `obj` (they have the same properties, but are different objects in memory).
- `obj === obj2` is `false` because they are not the same object (just identical in content).

### **Summary Table**

| Operation                       | What it does                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Object.assign(target, source)` | Copies properties from `source` to `target`, overriding duplicates        |
| `Object.assign({}, obj)`        | Makes a shallow copy of `obj`                                             |
| `obj === obj2`                  | Checks if both variables point to the same object (here, returns `false`) |

---

**Bottom line:**

- `Object.assign()` is a static method for copying properties.
- Later sources override earlier ones for matching keys.
- You can use it to merge objects or make shallow copies.
- Copied objects are still separate in memory.
