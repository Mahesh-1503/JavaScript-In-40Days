# Introduction to React.js for Absolute Beginners

## What is React?

React (also called React.js or ReactJS) is a **JavaScript library** that helps you build user interfaces for websites and web applications. In simpler terms, React makes it easier to create interactive, dynamic, and fast web pages.

## Who Developed React and Why?

React was **created by Facebook**. Facebookâ€™s engineers wanted a better way to build websites that could handle a lot of user interactions and update themselves quickly. They needed something fast, simple, and easy to maintain. So, Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, created React, and it was first released in **2013**.

## What is the Latest Version of React?

As of September 2025, the **latest major version of React is 19** (React 19). React keeps improving with new features and bug fixes, so itâ€™s always good to check the [official React website](https://react.dev/) for the newest version.

## What is React Used For?

React is mainly used to build **single-page applications (SPAs)**, where you have a dynamic website that loads content without requiring full-page reloads. You can use React for:

- Websites
- Web applications (like Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Twitter, etc.)
- Mobile apps (using React Native)
- Desktop apps (using Electron)

## What is Component-Based Architecture?

This is a key idea in React!

- **Component:** A component is a small, reusable piece of code that controls a part of the user interface (UI). For example, a button, a form, or a navigation bar can all be components.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Instead of writing one big file for the whole website, you break your UI into small components. Each component does one thing and can be reused anywhere.

**Example:**  
Imagine a car. The car is made up of components like wheels, engine, doors, etc. Similarly, you build a website using many small React components.

## What is the Actual DOM and Virtual DOM?

### Actual DOM (Document Object Model)

- The DOM is like a tree structure that represents the content of your web page.
- When you update something in the DOM (like a button click), the whole tree can be re-rendered, which can be slow for big, complex pages.

### Virtual DOM

- React uses a **virtual DOM**, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.
- When you change something, React updates the virtual DOM first, compares it with the actual DOM, and **only updates the parts that changed**.
- This makes React apps **much faster and more efficient**.

**In short:**  
Virtual DOM = Faster updates, better performance.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Actual DOM and Virtual DOM

### Actual DOM

**Advantages:**
- Directly represents the web page.
- Well-known and supported by browsers.

**Disadvantages:**
- Slow updates for large or dynamic web pages.
- Every change can cause the whole page to re-render.

### Virtual DOM

**Advantages:**
- Much faster updates and rendering.
- Only changes whatâ€™s necessary.
- Makes building complex, interactive interfaces easier.

**Disadvantages:**
- Slightly more memory usage (because of the virtual copy).
- Adds a layer of abstraction, so debugging can sometimes be a bit harder.

## What Does "Declarative" Mean in React?

React is **declarative**. This means you tell React **what you want**, not **how to do it**.

**Example:**  
Suppose you want to show a list of items.  
- In imperative programming (like plain JavaScript), youâ€™d write step-by-step instructions for how to create each item and add it to the page.
- In declarative programming (like React), you just describe what the UI should look like, and React figures out the steps.

**This makes your code easier to read and maintain.**

## Why Should You Learn React?

- Very popular in the job market
- Used by big companies (Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Airbnb, Uber, and more)
- Makes building web apps faster and easier
- Big community and lots of resources

## Core React Concepts Every Beginner Should Know

- **JSX:** A special syntax that lets you write HTML-like code in JavaScript.
- **Components:** The building blocks of React apps.
- **Props:** Short for "properties." These are inputs to components.
- **State:** Data that can change over time in a component.
- **Hooks:** Special functions (like `useState`, `useEffect`) that let you use state and other React features.

## Summary

- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Developed by Facebook to make web pages fast and interactive.
- Uses component-based architecture for reusable, manageable code.
- Uses a virtual DOM for fast updates.
- Declarative: You describe what you want the UI to look like.
- Latest major version: React 19.
- Used by lots of companies and has a great community.
