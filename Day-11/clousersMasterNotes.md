# JavaScript Closures - Master Notes

Closures are one of the most powerful and sometimes confusing concepts in JavaScript. If you master closures, you will unlock a deeper understanding of how JavaScript works under the hood, and youâ€™ll be able to write more robust, flexible code.

These notes break down closures from the absolute basics to advanced use-cases, in a way that even a complete beginner can become a master!

## 1. What is a Closure?

A **closure** is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. In simple terms, a closure allows a function to remember and access variables from outside its own scope, **even after the outer function has finished executing**.

**Definition in Simple Words:**  
A closure is a function "remembering" the variables from where it was created.

---

## 2. The Building Blocks: Scope

Before closures, you must understand **scope**.

- **Global Scope:** Variables declared outside any function/block are in the global scope.
- **Function Scope:** Variables declared inside a function are only accessible inside that function.
- **Block Scope (ES6+):** Variables declared with `let` or `const` inside `{}` are block scoped.

```js
let a = 10; // global

function foo() {
  let b = 20; // function
  if (true) {
    let c = 30; // block
    console.log(c); // 30
  }
  // console.log(c); // ERROR: c is not defined
}
```

---

## 3. The Birth of a Closure

Whenever you create a function inside another function, and the inner function references variables from the outer function, a closure is formed.

### Example 1: Basic Closure

```js
function outer() {
  let message = "Hello from outer!";
  function inner() {
    console.log(message); // inner "remembers" message
  }
  return inner;
}

const myClosure = outer(); // outer() runs, returns inner()
myClosure(); // "Hello from outer!"
```

**What's happening?**  
Even after `outer()` has finished, `myClosure()` still has access to `message` because of the closure.

---

## 4. Why Are Closures Useful?

- **Data Privacy / Encapsulation**
- **Partial Application / Currying**
- **Function Factories**
- **Event Handlers & Callbacks**

---

## 5. Data Privacy with Closures

Closures let you have "private" variables that can't be accessed from outside.

### Example 2: Private Variables

```js
function Counter() {
  let count = 0; // private
  return {
    increment: function () {
      count++;
      return count;
    },
    decrement: function () {
      count--;
      return count;
    },
    get: function () {
      return count;
    },
  };
}

const myCounter = Counter();
console.log(myCounter.increment()); // 1
console.log(myCounter.increment()); // 2
console.log(myCounter.decrement()); // 1
console.log(myCounter.get()); // 1
// console.log(myCounter.count); // undefined!
```

---

## 6. Closures in Loops (Classic Interview Trap)

### Example 3: Closures in Loops - The Problem

```js
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000);
}
// Output: 4, 4, 4 (after 1 second, 3 times)
```

**Why?**  
All three functions share the same `i` (the one in the outer scope), which becomes 4 after the loop.

### Solution: Use Closure to Capture Each Value

```js
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  (function (j) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log(j);
    }, 1000);
  })(i);
}
// Output: 1, 2, 3
```

Or with `let` (block scoped):

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000);
}
```

---

## 7. Function Factories with Closures

Functions that create and return other functions can use closures to make "customized" functions.

### Example 4: Function Factory

```js
function makeMultiplier(multiplier) {
  return function (x) {
    return x * multiplier;
  };
}

const double = makeMultiplier(2);
const triple = makeMultiplier(3);

console.log(double(5)); // 10
console.log(triple(5)); // 15
```

---

## 8. Closures in Real Life: Event Handlers

Closures keep variables alive for event handlers and callbacks.

### Example 5: Button Click Handler

```js
function setupButton(buttonId, message) {
  document.getElementById(buttonId).onclick = function () {
    alert(message);
  };
}

setupButton("btn1", "Clicked Button 1");
setupButton("btn2", "Clicked Button 2");
```

Each button "remembers" its own message.

---

## 9. Advanced: Currying with Closures

Currying is making a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each with one argument.

### Example 6: Currying

```js
function sum(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return function (c) {
      return a + b + c;
    };
  };
}

console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)); // 6
```

## 10. Common Gotchas & Tips

- Variables in closures are **live** â€“ if they change in the outer scope, the closure sees the change.
- Closures can cause memory leaks if not used carefully (e.g., holding onto DOM nodes).
- Always use `let` or `const` in loops to avoid classic closure bugs.

## 11. Visualizing Closures

You can use [JavaScript Visualizer](https://pythontutor.com/javascript.html) to step through and see how closures work in memory.

---

## 12. Super Extreme Example: Closure with Asynchronous Code

```js
function fetchData(url) {
  let cache;
  return function () {
    if (cache) {
      return Promise.resolve(cache);
    } else {
      return fetch(url)
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then((data) => {
          cache = data;
          return data;
        });
    }
  };
}

const getUser = fetchData("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1");
getUser().then((user) => console.log(user)); // Fetches from network
getUser().then((user) => console.log(user)); // Returns cached user
```

---

## 13. Practice Time

Try to solve these yourself!

1. Write a function that returns a function that adds a specific number to its input.
2. Make a secret password function: once set, you can check guesses, but never see the password.
3. Make a function that remembers how many times itâ€™s been called.

## 14. Summary

- **Closure = Function + Its Surrounding Variables ("Lexical Environment")**
- Closures allow data privacy, function factories, currying, and more.
- Mastering closures helps you deeply understand JavaScript.
